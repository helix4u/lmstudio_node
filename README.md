# lmstudio_node
A simple node to interact with a self hosted instance of LM Studio. 

trying to revive the old ooba node but with a more user friendly local API provider.

needs addition of things like model selection.

rn you need to edit the node file to change the model, address, api key, etc.

this code needs to be updated.. you'll need an old version of openai api. look for the warning in the error console if you have issues and need the version.
